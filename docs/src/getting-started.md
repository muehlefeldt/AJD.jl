# Getting Started Guide
This guide provides information on the basic usage of the AJD.jl package.

## Installation
To install the Package follow these instructions to add the package to a basic Julia environment or use the package in a Pluto notebook.

### Julia
Create temporary environment in the [Julia REPL](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/REPL/):
```julia
] activate --temp
```
Add the package:
```julia
] add https://github.com/muehlefeldt/AJD.jl
```

### Pluto
The use in [Pluto notebooks](https://plutojl.org/) is supported. Add the package in one cell of the notebook:
```julia
begin
    using Pkg
    Pkg.activate("MyTestEnv")
    Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/muehlefeldt/AJD.jl")
    using AJD
end
```

## Basic usage
The most basic usage of the package given a vector ``M`` of ``k`` square matrices (``n \times n``):
```julia
using AJD
filter = diagonalize(M)
```

The returned object `filter` of `diagonalize()` is a LinearFilter containing the matrix ``F`` as well as ``F'``. Assuming ``A \in M`` these are used to diagonalize ``A`` by calculating ``D = F' * A * F``. ``D`` being the diagonalized matrix. In Julia you calculate:
```julia
D = filter.iF * A * filter.F
```

## Advanced options
The main function `diagonalize()` provides several options to be choosen by the user.

### Algorithms
The package allows to choose diffrent algorithms to calculate the AJD.
#### JDiag
Three implementations of the JDiag algorithm are avalaible [1]:
* The Cardoso implementation is based on [Matlab Code by Cardoso](https://www2.iap.fr/users/cardoso/jointdiag.html). Use the keyword `algorithm="jdiag_cardoso"`.
* Based on a [Python implementation by Gabrieldernbach](https://github.com/gabrieldernbach/approximate_joint_diagonalization/) the second implementation is suitable for matrices consisting of real and complex values. Use the keyword `algorithm="jdiag_gabrieldernbach"`.
* The third implementation of JDiag is based on the [Python code by Edouardpineau](https://github.com/edouardpineau/Time-Series-ICA-with-SOBI-Jacobi) also supports real and complex matrices, as well as hermitian matrices included in the module `PosDefManifold.jl`, which are used in the `Diagonalizations.jl` package too. Use the keyword `algorithm="jdiag_edourdpineau"`.

For example execute:
```julia
# Generate 1000 matrices of 10 x 10 size.
M = AJD.random_normal_commuting_matrices(10, 1000)
# Diagonalize M using selected algorithm.
digonalize(M, algorithm="jdiag_edourdpineau")
```

#### FFDiag
One implementation of the FFDiag algorithm is available through the keyword `algorithm="ffdiag"` [2].

For example execute:
```julia
# Generate 1000 matrices of 10 x 10 size.
M = AJD.random_normal_commuting_matrices(10, 1000)
# Diagonalize M using selected algorithm.
digonalize(M, algorithm="ffdiag")
```

### Plotting
Visual feedback is available by optional plots of the convergence behaviour and heatmaps of the filter matrix as well as the diagonlized matrices.

#### Plot Convergence
To plot the convergence behaviour use the keyword `plot_convergence=true`. An example output of random matrices can be generated by
```julia
# Generate 1000 matrices of 10 x 10 size.
M = AJD.random_normal_commuting_matrices(10, 1000)
# Diagonalize M.
diagonalize(M, plot_convergence=true)
```
The generate plot:

#### Plot Filter and Diagonalized matrix
To plot the filter matrix and the diagonalized matrices use the keyword `plot_matrix=true`. The diagonalized matrices ``D_k`` are summarised and only ``mean(D_k)`` is plotted to provide an overview. Execute:
```julia
# Generate 1000 matrices of 10 x 10 size.
M = AJD.random_normal_commuting_matrices(10, 1000)
# Diagonalize M.
diagonalize(M, plot_matrix=true)
```
The generated plot:

### Benchmarking
All implementations of the algorithms can be benchmarked by executing:
```julia
# Using matrices of size 10 x 10. Use 1000 random matrices for each benchmarked run.
ajd_benchmark(10, 1000)
```

Large input sizes require a lot compute time due to repeated execution.
