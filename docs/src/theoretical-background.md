# Theoretical Background

This module implements Approximate Joint Diagonalization (AJD) of multiple matrices.

[1] *Jacobi Angles for Simultaneous Diagonalization* by Jean-François Cardoso and Antoine Souloumiac: SIAM journal on matrix analysis and applications 17.1 (1996): 161-164.

At some point the module will also contain the algorithm proposed in the paper: 

[2] *A fast algorithm for joint diagonalization with non-orthogonal transformations and its application to blind source separation* by Andreas Ziehe, Pavel Laskov, Guido Nolte, and Klaus-Robert Müller published in *The Journal of Machine Learning Research*, 5:777– 800, 2004.
